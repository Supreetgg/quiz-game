## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Questions are stored in a JavaScript array (`quizQuestions`).
2. Each question has a `text` property for the answer and a `correct` boolean to mark the right answer.
3. The game loops through each question, displays the possible answers, and waits for the player’s selection.
4. The score is updated based on correct answers.
